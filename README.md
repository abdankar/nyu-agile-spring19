# **AI VS HUMANS**



This [article](https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/11/tech/ai-versus-human-ibm-debate/index.html), >AI vs Human IBM Debate, is yet another example of how artificial intelligence is becoming more and more human. I've always been very interested in how AI can replace the need for humans in certain facets. With all the data available in the world today, there is so much for these systems to work with and learn from. Similar to this case was one about IBM's Watson being able to replace lawyers by solving full cases after ingesting large amounts of case data. The applications are incredible to think about, and, as some contend, potentially even scary.

It has the potential to change many industries
* finance
* law
* tech
* etc.

I'm also curious as to how this technology could potentially be hazardous to humans, and what kinds of regulations society will come up with to curtail the beast.

**Privacy** is a huge issue, with all the data out there companies will be incentivized to monetize it. 

**Sentience** could be an issue too, what happens if the machines take over?

Despite the issues, we are in for an interesting time ahead of us.  

WOW THIS IS AMAZING. This Changes Everything!!!!!

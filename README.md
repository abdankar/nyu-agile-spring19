This [article](https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/11/tech/ai-versus-human-ibm-debate/index.html), >AI vs Human IBM Debate, is yet another example of how artificial intelligence is becoming more and more human.

With all the data available in the world today, there is so much for these systems to work with and learn from. Similar to this case was one about IBM's Watson being able to replace lawyers by solving full cases after ingesting large amounts of case data. The applications are incredible to think about, and, as some contend, potentially even scary.
